# 🌍 Disaster Relief Management System

A **role-based desktop disaster coordination platform** built using **C# WinForms and Microsoft SQL Server**.  
The system connects **victims, donors, volunteers, administrators, and managers** to streamline **disaster help requests, donations, delivery tracking, and administrative control** in real-world emergency situations.

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming, layered architecture, and database-driven desktop application development**.

# 🚀 Features

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

The system supports **five user roles**, each with dedicated permissions:

- **Victim**
  - Create disaster help requests  
  - Track received donations and deliveries  

- **Donator**
  - View approved disaster requests  
  - Donate items or resources  
  - Track donation history and delivery status  

- **Volunteer**
  - Accept delivery assignments  
  - Update delivery progress (Assigned → In Transit → Delivered)  

- **Admin**
  - Manage users and disaster requests  
  - Approve or reject victim requests  
  - Monitor system statistics and activity  

- **Manager**
  - Create and manage admin accounts  
  - Activate or deactivate admins  
  - Maintain administrative control of the system  

This structured workflow ensures **secure coordination and transparency** during disaster response.

# 🧠 System Workflow

1. Users **register and log in** according to their role.  
2. Victims **submit disaster help requests**.  
3. Admins **review and approve requests**.  
4. Donators **provide donations** to approved requests.  
5. Volunteers **deliver donated items** to victims.  
6. Manager **oversees admin management and system authority**.  

The system acts as a **central bridge between affected victims and humanitarian support providers**.
